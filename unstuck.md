# üÜò Getting Help
There will be times in this class where you feel like you're stuck--that's perfectly okay and a big part of doing computer science. If you are stuck for longer than 30 minutes on one thing, please reach out and get help. Here are some things you can do to get unstuck:

## üì¨ Use Slack
If you have a question, don't hesitate to post it on Slack. The `#assignments` channel is a great place to discuss assignment related questions and the `#general` channel is great for discussing any topic related to the class.

>**TIP:**
>On Slack, you can tag me by adding `@Meredith Moore` to your message. This will notify me immediately of your post. You can also message me privately by sending me a *Direct Message*.

## üè´ Office Hours
This semester, we will be [using Calendly to schedule office hours](https://calendly.com/meredith-moore/office-hours). Feel free to grab more than one slot if you don't think 15 minutes is enough time. <br>

| **Monday** |**Tuesday** |**Wednesday**|**Thursday** |**Friday**|
| ---------- | ---------- | ----------| ---------- | ----------| 
| 11:00 - 12:00 | 12:30 - 2:00| 11:00 - 12:00 | 12:30 - 2:00| email me if needed |

If you have a question, please send me an email or a message via Slack. The above hours are times that I guarantee I will be available for a virtual/in-person meeting. I will likely be in my office during the day whenever I am not in class or in a meeting. To guarantee a time we can meet outside of my office hours, contact me via email or Slack and we will set up a time when both of us are avaible. 

## üßë‚Äçüè´ CS Tutors ##
Drake University offers **free** tutoring services for introductory computer science students. If you are interested in scheduling an individual tutoring appointment, visit the [Tutoring Services](https://www.drake.edu/access-success/tutoring/#Math/Computer%20Science) page.

## ‚úâÔ∏è Email Tips 

Here are a few tips to make our communication as efficient as possible this semester.

### 1. Who:
Let's start by the **who** to send it to. If you are looking for help debugging your code, make sure you send it to both:
- to [Professor Moore](mailto:meredith.moore@drake.edu)
- The CS167 TA: [Sigi Brock](mailto:sigi.brock@drake.edu)

If you also CC the TA this increases your chances of getting a quick response to your question. 

### 2. What: 
A successful email to the professor, specifcially an email that is looking for help debugging some code should have a few components:
- **Descriptive Subject**: Start off with a Subject line that is descriptive. Include the Course Number (CS65), your Section Number (0 or 1), and the assignment that you are having trouble with.
- **Problem**: Include a concise description of the problem 
- **The Error**: What's gone wrong? Is there an error? If so, be sure to include the error. Make sure it's easy to understand where you got stuck.
- **Things you've tried**: Include a description of what you've tried to get past this problem so far. 
<!---Not sure where to start? Check out these [debugging tips](/debugging_tips/).--->
- **Link to Your Updated Code**: This one is important. Be sure to push (save) your most recent code to GitHub, and include the link to your GitHub repository in your email. 

### 3. When:
While the Instructor and TAs will do their best to respond to your questions quickly and efficiently, the closer to the deadline that you ask the question, 
the less likely there will be time for us to answer your question before the deadline. Get started on your assignments early, and be sure to ask questions early and often.

## Examples:

### üëé What _not_ to do:
Here is an example of an email that is not very helpful. See if you can spot what Timmy did wrong:

### üëç What to do:
Here is an example of an email that includes all of the above. 
>*Please note that you should use the actual TA's email address, as ImTheCS65TA@drake.edu is not a real email address, please use [sigi.brock@drake.edu](mailto:sigibrock@drake.edu), instead.*
